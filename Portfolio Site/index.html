                    <h1>Hello, I'm Rafael, a UI/UX designer based in USA</h1>
                    <p>My journey into UI/UX design began as I encountered numerous apps and websites with complicated and unintuitive interfaces. This experience ignited my passion for minimalist design, leading me to specialize in creating sleek, user-friendly interfaces that cater to individuals of all tech-savviness levels. My aim is to transform complex digital experiences into accessible and enjoyable ones. Outside of design, I have a penchant for exploring new places, and I find joy in repairing laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In my leisure time, I also enjoy immersing myself in the world of video games.

                    In developing my app on Figma, I applied UI/UX Design to create user-friendly interfaces and Graphic Design for visually appealing layouts. I also engaged in Prototyping, Market Research for understanding my target audience's needs in renewed electronics, and Brand Awareness to align the design with the brand's values. My work showcased Attention to Detail, Creative Thinking in design solutions.
